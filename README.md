### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?

    Did some sreaching on the web to find a simple swiftui example on fetching JSON and converting it to an swift object. Once that was out of the way
    move onto creating a view to list the image, cuisine, nane of recipe in list view. To keep the main view code down, I create reusable cell view for 
    each of the items in the list.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
    
    The day after getting the email about this take home project, I spent about hour or so getting github desktop 
    installed and having it create the public resporitry for this project. Total time spent on the project was about 4 hours.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
    

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
    
    The weakest part of the project could be not much imagenation with view the is being shown when the JSON is Malformed or an empty JSON.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
    Alot of my swift programing for iOS was using UIkit, with that said, I decide to use the the limited swiftUI l
    anaguage that I know to do this project.
